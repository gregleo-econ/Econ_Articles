**What is Gale Profit Maximization with Inequality?**

Gale Profit Maximization with Inequality is a business model that aims to maximize profits by allocating resources across different customer segments or markets, taking into account the varying levels of revenue and profit margins among them.

3. **Segment 3:** Middle-range segments, like general retail stores or restaurants, may receive a balance of resources and pricing that suits their profitability levels.
4. **Segment 4:** Low-profit segments, such as those with low profit margins but still offer value to customers (e.g., online retailers), may receive more resources and lower prices.
