# Coase Expenditure Minimization under Time Inconsistency

**Coase Expenditure Minimization Under Time Consistency**

In economics, a coaseman is a measure of how much time it takes to complete a transaction. The concept of coaseman was introduced by Ronald Coase in the 1960s and has since been widely applied in various fields, including microeconomics, macroeconomics, and finance. Coase's work focused on understanding the behavior of transactions under time consistency, which refers to the idea that parties will settle their differences when they have a clear understanding of what is being agreed upon.

Coase Expenditure Minimization Under Time Consistency

In the context of coaseman, an expenditure minimization strategy aims to reduce the amount of time it takes for parties to reach an agreement on a transaction. This can be achieved by various means, such as:

1. **Time compression**: Reducing the duration between transactions or negotiations.
2. **Time extension**: Increasing the length of time spent on a transaction or negotiation.
3. **Time reduction**: Minimizing the amount of time spent on a transaction or negotiation.
4. **Coalition formation**: Encouraging parties to form coalitions, which can lead to more efficient and effective negotiations.
5. **Negotiation strategies**: Using techniques such as binding offers, counteroffers, and concessions to facilitate mutually beneficial agreements.

The coaseman strategy is particularly useful in situations where time constraints are significant, such as:

1. **International trade**: In international trade, the coaseman approach can help parties negotiate more efficiently when there are time constraints on their schedules or deadlines.
2. **Negotiation over large sums of money**: When negotiating a large sum of money, the coaseman strategy can help parties reach an agreement quickly and efficiently.
3. **Time-sensitive transactions**: In situations where time is critical, such as in international trade negotiations or when dealing with high-stakes financial transactions, the coaseman approach can help parties negotiate more effectively.

Examples of Coase Expenditure Minimization Under Time Consistency

To illustrate the concept of coaseman, consider the following examples:

1. **The Texas Chili Cook-Off**: In 2009, a group of Texans and Texans from California came together to cook up a storm at a chili cook-off in Austin. The event was held over two days, with each side cooking for an hour on the first day and another hour on the second day. To minimize time, the parties divided their cooking into smaller batches, which allowed them to prepare dishes more efficiently.
2. **The Paris Marathon**: In 2018, a group of runners from Paris and New York City came together for a marathon in the French capital city. The event was held over two days, with each runner preparing for their portion of the race on the first day. To minimize time, the runners divided their training into smaller segments, which allowed them to complete their workouts more efficiently.
3. **The 2018 World Cup**: In 2018, the United States and Brazil came together to host the 2018 World Cup in Qatar. The event was held over two days, with each country preparing for its portion of the tournament on the first day. To minimize time, the teams divided their preparation into smaller segments, which allowed them to complete their training more efficiently.

In conclusion, coaseman is a powerful strategy that can help parties negotiate more effectively and efficiently under time consistency. By understanding the principles of coaseman, negotiators can use it to their advantage in various fields, from international trade negotiations to business deals and personal relationships.
