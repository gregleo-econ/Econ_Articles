**The Basics of Continuous Time Auctions**

In a continuous time auction, bidders can place bids at any point in time, unlike traditional auctions where prices are set at specific intervals. This means that bidder's actions influence the outcome of the auction, creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment.

This enables investors to make more informed decisions about when to enter or exit trades, reducing the risk of impulsive buying or selling.

**Dynamic Bidding and Price Adjustments**

The continuous time auction format allows for dynamic bidding, which means bidders can adjust their bids in real-time based on market conditions. This flexibility enables buyers to respond quickly to changes in prices, ensuring that they remain aligned with the market's evolving dynamics. Additionally, the platform uses algorithms to dynamically adjust prices in response to changing market conditions, further enhancing the auction's ability to adapt to shifting markets.
