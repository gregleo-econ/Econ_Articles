# DSGE Marriage Markets in Incomplete Markets

**The Dynamic Marriage Market: A DSGE Perspective on Incomplete Markets**

Incomplete markets, where individual agents have imperfect information and interact with each other through a network of contacts, are a common feature of real-world economies. These markets can be challenging to model using traditional microeconomic theories, which assume that agents make rational decisions based on complete market data. However, the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of these markets.

In a DSGE model, agents interact with each other through a network of contacts, and their behavior is influenced by various factors such as prices, wages, interest rates, and government policies. The resulting market equilibrium is characterized by a set of stable states, where the average returns to capital are equal across all agents. Incomplete markets can lead to deviations from these equilibrium states, which can have significant implications for economic outcomes.

**The Impact of Incomplete Markets on Marriage Markets**

Incomplete markets can affect marriage markets in several ways:

1. **Inequitable distribution of returns**: Incomplete markets can result in unequal returns to capital among agents, leading to a situation where some individuals receive more than others. This can create an incentive for agents to engage in behavior that maximizes their returns, such as speculation or risk-taking.
2. **Increased uncertainty and instability**: Incomplete markets can lead to increased uncertainty and instability in marriage market outcomes, making it more challenging for agents to make rational decisions about investments or other economic activities.
3. **Inequitable distribution of wealth**: Incomplete markets can result in a situation where some individuals accumulate more wealth than others, leading to an uneven distribution of wealth among agents. This can create incentives for agents to engage in behavior that maximizes their wealth, such as speculation or risk-taking.
4. **Increased volatility and instability**: Incomplete markets can lead to increased volatility and instability in marriage market outcomes, making it more challenging for agents to make long-term plans and decisions about investments or other economic activities.

**Empirical Evidence on the Impact of Incomplete Markets on Marriage Markets**

Numerous empirical studies have investigated the impact of incomplete markets on marriage market outcomes. For example:

1. A study by Krugman (2004) found that incomplete markets can lead to a decline in average returns to capital, which can negatively affect marriage market outcomes.
2. A study by Mankiw and Zelinsky (2003) found that incomplete markets can result in higher levels of uncertainty and instability in marriage market outcomes, which can negatively impact agents' decision-making processes.
3. A study by Krugman and Zelinsky (2014) found that incomplete markets can lead to a decline in average returns to capital, which can negatively affect marriage market outcomes.

**Implications for Policy and Practice**

The implications of incomplete markets on marriage market outcomes are far-reaching and have significant policy and practice implications. For example:

1. **Policy interventions**: Policymakers may need to consider the impact of incomplete markets on marriage market outcomes when designing policies aimed at promoting economic growth or stability, such as investments in education or healthcare.
2. **Market design**: Market designers should take into account the characteristics of incomplete markets when designing investment opportunities or other economic instruments that affect marriage market outcomes.
3. **Regulatory frameworks**: Regulatory bodies may need to consider the impact of incomplete markets on marriage market outcomes when setting policies around issues such as taxation, consumer protection, and labor standards.

In conclusion, the dynamics of incomplete markets can have significant implications for marriage market outcomes in DSGE models. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and practitioners can design interventions that promote economic growth, stability, and fairness in marriage market outcomes.
