**What are Incomplete Markets?**

Incomplete markets refer to situations where supply chains are unable to meet the immediate demands of customers due to various factors such as:

1. Limited availability of raw materials or components
2. Uncertainty about future demand patterns
3. Difficulty in sourcing products from suppliers
4. Regulatory constraints or restrictions on trade routes
5. Seasonal fluctuations or other external factors that impact supply chain performance

Incomplete markets can be found in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and logistics, where the demand for specific products may not always align with their availability. Examples include:

* Agricultural supply chains struggling to meet growing demand from consumers who prioritize organic produce over cheaper alternatives
* Manufacturing supply chains facing challenges due to changes in global trade policies or material shortages
* Logistics companies dealing with unpredictable weather patterns, transportation disruptions, or other external factors that impact delivery schedules
