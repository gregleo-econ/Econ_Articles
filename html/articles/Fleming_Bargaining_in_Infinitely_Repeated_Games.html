<p><strong>Fleming Bargaining in Infinitely Repeated Games</strong></p>
<p>In infinitely repeated games, where the outcome is determined by a sequence of events that repeats indefinitely, the concept of bargaining becomes even more fascinating. The idea of bargaining, which involves negotiating with another player to reach an agreement on a price or other terms, can be applied to infinite games in several ways. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Infinite-length bargaining</strong>: Imagine two players, Alice and Bob, who have the same initial payoff (e.g., $100) from a game where they both win 50% of the total amount. They can negotiate to reach an agreement on a price, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll get exactly what they want. The negotiation process becomes infinite, and the outcome is determined by the sequence of events in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite-length bargaining with multiple players</strong>: Suppose Alice and Bob have two friends, Alice and Bob, who are each playing a different game (e.g., a card game or a board game). They can negotiate to reach an agreement on a price for a specific game, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll get the same outcome as if they were playing alone. The negotiation process becomes infinite, with multiple players potentially agreeing on different outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite-length bargaining with multiple payoffs</strong>: Imagine Alice and Bob are both playing a game where they have two options: buy or sell an item (e.g., a car). They can negotiate to reach an agreement on the price of the item, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll get exactly what they want. The negotiation process becomes infinite, with multiple payoffs potentially affecting the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite-length bargaining with multiple outcomes</strong>: Suppose Alice and Bob are both playing a game where they have two options: buy or sell an item (e.g., a car) in different markets (e.g., one in the US and one in Europe). They can negotiate to reach an agreement on the price of the item, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll get exactly what they want. The negotiation process becomes infinite, with multiple outcomes potentially affecting the outcome.</li>

</ol>
<p>In each of these examples, the bargaining process is characterized by a sequence of events where the outcome depends on the initial conditions (e.g., the initial payoff or number of players) and the subsequent actions taken by the parties involved. The goal of bargaining in infinite games is to find an agreement that satisfies all parties’ interests while minimizing the overall cost of negotiation.</p>
<p>The concept of bargaining in infinite games has far-reaching implications for various fields, including economics, game theory, and social sciences. It can help us understand how individuals and groups negotiate with each other when faced with uncertain outcomes or conflicting priorities. By studying bargaining in infinite games, we can gain insights into the dynamics of cooperation, conflict resolution, and negotiation strategies that are essential to achieving mutually beneficial agreements.</p>
